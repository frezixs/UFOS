# UFOS

In this module, we will create a UFO sightings page using Javascript and bootstrap 

# Results 

When we first enter our website, there is a title with the picture at the top, as we scrolls down, 
we begin to see all the data and filters that we have. In total, we have 5 different filters: date, cuty, state, country and shape. 
The webpage will change accordingly as you choose different filters.

# Summary 

## Drawback 
validating the sitings that happened. We need how many people were at the siting. 
we also need to collect the status of the people, if the people is drunk or have some mental disease, then we can't believe 
what he says. 

## Recommendations 
#### 1. 
Have more data and information, for example, how many people see a UFO at once, or add a duration filter. 

#### 2. 
we should somehow analysis the comments, although its a mess, but in comments there are a lot of information. 
for example, the colour etc. 

#### 3. 
Add a filter that collect the status of eyewitness, if they are drunk or have some mental disease, then their results 
have higher possibility to be a falsehood.
